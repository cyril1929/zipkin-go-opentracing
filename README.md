# zipkin-go-opentracing

[OpenTracing](http://opentracing.io) Tracer implementation for [Zipkin](http://zipkin.io) v1 in Go.

### Notes

This is a fork of version v0.3.5 of the repository https://github.com/openzipkin-contrib/zipkin-go-opentracing.  
Indeed version v0.3.5 is the last version to manage Zipkin v1, and is unfortunately no longer maintained.  
This fork aims to maintain this version, mainly updating external dependencies with security vulnerabilities.
